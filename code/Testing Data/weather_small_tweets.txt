T-minus 1 minute and counting. #Orb1
T-minus 2 minutes and counting to #Orb1 launch.
"T-minus 5 minutes to #Orb1 launch. If you're in the prime launch viewing area, step outside and take a look! http://t.co/yQVY0xVb8I"
T-10 minutes to #Orb1 launch. All systems GO for launch.
"Based on the clocks on the video feed, it looks like the exact planned T-0 is 1:07:05 p.m. ET. (18:07:05 UTC)"
RT @OrbitalSciences: #Cygnus on internal power - ready for launch. #Orb1
Range is now GREEN for DFO. #Orb1
The duck hunters have been cleared from the launch safety zone. Range still red for DFO. #Orb1
"Range is also red for ""duck hunters in the launch hazard area."" No ETA on clearance time. #Orb1"
RT @OrbitalSciences: Still working DFO issue. Data still coming in. DFO needs to clear. #Orb1 #Antares #Cygnus
No word on how late a go/no-go decision can be made for the range DFO violation. Should be more balloon data coming in for analysis. #Orb1
Just under L-1 hour. Range still red for DFO violation. All other systems reporting green. #Orb1
"RT @OrbitalSciences: We have a ""go"" for propellant loading operations for the #Antares #Orb1 mission"
#Orb1 propellant loading operations go/no-go poll currently underway.
Another discussion on the #Orb1 countdown loop about an issue with RP-1 (fuel) tank pressure.
The next weather balloon should be released in the next few minutes to continue to assess atmospheric conditions. #Orb1
"Conditions observed by a weather ballon launched last hour are ""not trending in a good direction"" re: DFO range criteria."
The #Orb1 launch weather officer reports 5 percent overall chance of weather criteria violations at launch time.
"DFO: ""an atmospheric phenomenon that can produce 
greatly enhanced overpressure due to sonic velocity gradients w/respect to 
altitude."""
"L-1 hour 30 minute launch weather briefing currently underway. Mostly sunny conditions, no precipitation expected through the launch window."
"Unconfirmed, but it sounded like the range is red for DFO, or distant focusing overpressure. http://t.co/sydiZ2uy2M"
Just reported on the #Orb1 countdown loop that the range is currently red (no-go) for launch.
Planned 12-minute #Orb1 countdown hold scheduled for 11:25:06 ET. 5-minute launch window still opens at 1:07 p.m. ET.
"RT @OrbitalSciences: LOX leak was on a maintenance line, all checked out and we are proceeding with the countdown. #Orb1 #Antares #Cygnus"

The impacts of a G3 geomagnetic storm on Earth should be relatively minor. Could be some prime aurora viewing.
"Modeling and forecasting space weather has greatly improved recently, but it is still not yet well understood as weather on Earth."
"The CME is forecast to reach Earth early Thursday morning EST, but there is some uncertainty in the timing. G3 forecast in effect Thu-Fri."
"Strong (G3 on the NOAA scale) geomagnetic storms occur roughly 200 times per 11-year solar cycle, so this is not an unusual event."
Tuesday's X1 solar flare and associated coronal mass ejection (CME) are expected to cause a strong geomagnetic storm later this week. But…
