This is Tim: The Macworld transcript of Tim Cook on today's earnings call: http://t.co/pgAyhmigXA
"P.S. Apple is doomed, according to the business press."
"And that's a wrap. Check out http://t.co/j82qYbfNpE, where later today we'll have a transcript, analysis, and more."
Cook: Combine sales of Apple TV and content bought directly off Apple TV in 2013 = over $1 billion. Apple has sold 20m Apple TVs.
Cook: Planning to triple the number of Apple retail stores in China in the next two years.
"Cook: In China, 62% of 4s buyers, 60% of 5c buyers switched from Android. China is fastest-growing region."
"Cook on China: best quarter ever at $10b. iPhone sales up 28%, Mac up 13%, software/services up more than double."
Cook on the smartphone market: The part of the market we're in is people who want the best smartphone.
"Cook on acquisitions: We don't have to spend the most, and we don't have a rule against spending a lot. We do what makes sense."
Cook: Customers don't care about the first product to market. They want a great product.
"Cook: We didn't ship the first MP3 player, smartphone, or tablet. We shipped the first successful ones."
"Cook: We care about getting every detail right, and that takes longer."
"Cook: We're expanding the number of things that we're working on, but we're not ready to pull the string on the curtain."
"Cook: Very bullish on iPad, despite ""the street's"" concerns about year-over-year decline in Q2."
Chart of Apple revenue by geographic segment 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/8XVLHK6NSA
"Cook: Office for iPad helps the iPad, but unclear how much. Would have been even better for Microsoft if it had been done earlier."
(Cook is likely referencing readers and media devices that technically run Android but aren't really full-featured tablets.)
"Cook: iPad has 46% share of US retail market, but that number is weighed down by ""a lot of things we wouldn't put in there"""
Cook: 98% of Fortune 500 are using iPads; 97% of enterprise table activations are iPads.
Cook: iPad has 95% share of education market. Student achievement is higher with iPad in the classroom than it is without it.
"Cook: iPad has been the fastest-growing product in Apple history. Instant hit in consumer, business, and education. Sold 210m in 4yrs."
Cook: majority of our attention is in making great products that get users excited to want them. Not stuck on certain price points.
"Cook: Happy to sell people in emerging markets the 4s -- ""a great product at a great value."""
"Cook: The big opportunity for Apple is that the smartphone market is still only 1b or so units, but it will eventually be the entire market."
Chart: Apple's Q2 revenue by product line http://t.co/IUltPGuXqi
"@Brian_Bloch Right, but Apple's official position is that the transition starts in June -- that's when Maestri takes over the title."
Maestri: iPhone avg selling price was down partly because of success of 4s in emerging markets--affected mix.
"New carrier policies that force users to wait two full years for subsidized upgrade did affect sales, but overall, demand was high."
"Maestri: Q was good because of better volume, better costs, favorable mix of products and services."
"@mojoguzzi @noahi Year markings = Q1 (holiday quarter), which is why they're so much higher. They aren't yearly summaries."
(Apple now taking questions.)
(Clarification: Oppenheimer is transitioning from CFO in June. Retiring in September.)
"Cook talking about Peter Oppenheimer, who is retiring in June. ""Has never missed guidance in his 10 years at Apple"""
Cook: 7-for-1 stock split to make stock more accessible. Every share as of June 2 will get 6 additional shares.
"Q3 guidance: Revenue between $36-$38 billion, 37-38% gross margin, operating expenses $4.4-$4.5b"
"Maestri: Repatriating Apple's offshore cash would incur significant tax consequences, which wouldn't be in best interest of shareholders."
Interesting: all of the repurchase and dividend programs are funded by domestic cash.
(Currently going over the details of the stock repurchase and dividend programs.)
Maestri: latest data from IDC says iPad has over 95% share of US education tablet market.
Maestri: 98% customer-satisfaction rate among iPad owners. 2/3 of people planning to buy a tablet in next 90 days plan to buy iPad.
"Maestri: In North America, iPad users generated 4x web traffic of all Android users combined."
Chart of Mac revenue 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/ob09cnxXXR
Maestri: Mac has gained global market share 31 of last 32 quarters.
Maestri: iOS App Store app downloads &gt;70 billion. 87 percent of iOS devices running iOS 7. March revenue 85% higher than Google Play.
Chart of iTunes/software/services revenue 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/dpSRLJkDhy
iPhone revenue 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/N4KPrnhLTq
iPhone unit sales 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/0xva9SjUr1
"Luca Maestri: iPhone sales are up pretty much everywhere, both geographically and in enterprise."
Cook: Current Apple stock price does not reflect the value of the company.
"Cook: Apple acquired 24 companies in past 18 months; needs flexibility. (I.e., ""This is why we aren't giving investors all of our cash."")"
Chart of iPod revenue 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/KCOSHYUOlo
Chart of iPod unit sales 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/urmavAdm8p
"Cook: Apple added &gt;60m new users, over half of iPhone sales to people new to iPhone—tens of millions of new Apple customers."
Cook: Tablet sales will surpass PCs in a few years.
Cook: Apple continues to gain PC-market share. Making OS X free led to largest-ever % of installed Mac base running latest version.

"Cook: Apple gained smartphone share in US, UK, Japan, Germany, France, and more. iTunes revenue continues to grow at double-digit rate."
"Cook: This was the strongest non-holiday quarter ever for Apple, with $45.6b in revenue, best gross margins since 9/2012."
(Q2 is historically the weakest for Apple—it's after the holiday quarter but before education sales kick in.)
"Apple revenue chart, 2011 to 2014: http://t.co/K4QG5lkYS4"
"iPad sales down 17% in Q2 compared to year-ago Q2. Revenue down in Japan and China, but up everywhere else."
"Unit sales for 2014 Q2: 43.7 million iPhones, 16.4m iPads, 4.1m Macs, 2.8m iPods. All lower than Q1, but that was a holiday quarter."
"Apple is also increasing its shareholder return program, increasing dividends and repurchasing more shares; and doing a 7-for-1 split."
"Apple's press release: Rev. of $45.6 billion, up from $43.6 billion a year ago. Profit: $10.2b, up from $9.5b. Margins: 39.3%, up from 37.5."
