"Here's the temperature gradient which approaches the area by this afternoon. Heavy rain, strong winds accompany it. http://t.co/nKyPYIBN1u"
Can say with confidence that Yankees should make early call to postpone tonight's game. Steady rain/wind likely tonight.
"Good morning! Major frontal passage today will usher out the warm airmass. Clouds, showers early and then heavy rain, temp drop later today."
"Marine air influx is occurring a bit quicker than models were indicating, especially in regards to clouds. Could inhibit eclipse viewing."
"Tuesday still warm, but will feature much more clouds and rain with a more damp feel in the air. Bottom line: Enjoy the sunshine now!"
"Tonight, warmth continues across inland areas. But by late overnight period, low clouds and fog begin their march inland from the coast."
"Despite inland warmth, as noted a few days ago the southerly winds are keeping marine air locked in near the coasts. Cooler, windier there."
"ICYMI, total lunar eclipse tonight at 2:00am. We're carefully monitoring clouds, but as of now it looks like we should be able to view it."
Good morning! Warm this morning with temperatures still in the 60's. But we're back into the mid and upper 70's by this afternoon!
"Fair warning to bring jacket and umbrella on Tuesday. Major cold front with rain, wind and 30 degree temp drop. http://t.co/hp9Gdk17za"
The incredible weather continues this afternoon. Temperatures in the 70s to low 80s away from the shore. Hope you're all enjoying it!
"Amazing gradient between inland and beaches this time of year. Cold, marine air has huge influence on temperatures. http://t.co/Nl19rfQVlS"
Lunar eclipse tomorrow night (3am Tuesday morning)! But we'll be fighting clouds. Monitoring carefully and hoping for good viewing.
"Warmup continues, but marine air plays spoiler near the coast. Details, plus info on Tuesday's lunar eclipse. Here: http://t.co/XPfvFFX55t"
"The reason? South/southeasterly winds near the shore will bring in marine air off the very cool ocean waters. Much colder, more damp there."
Good morning! A beautiful day today across much of the area. Upper 70s for highs across all of NJ. But much cooler near the area coasts.
Good morning! A gem of a day on the way today. Highs in the 60s with plenty of sun and only a light breeze. Hope you can all enjoy it!
"74 at Central Park this hour, near 80 in many locations throughout Central NJ."
Widespread 70+ degree temperatures this afternoon with a light breeze. Some spots in NJ approaching 80. Doesn't get much better than this.
68 in Central Park at noon. Warmer than that over much of New Jersey. Hope you're all able to enjoy the warm weather!
Clouds hanging around a bit this morning but we're expecting the sun by this afternoon. Warming into the 60s (70s in NJ). More rain tonight.
"Regardless of temps, period of rain is likely tonight as a weakening frontal boundary approaches the area. Not a washout by any means."
"Cooler near the shore, typical for spring. Although likely overdone, HRRR indicates potential for upper 70's in NJ. http://t.co/LTYsb4EzKn"
"Good morning! A warmer start this morning, and with W-Swly winds many locations south of NYC will warm into the 70's this afternoon."
Moderate to strong El Nino becoming increasingly likely. Our research here: http://t.co/z3TgcuXdbl

"Good morning! Gorgeous day on the way today. Clear skies with lots of sun, a light breeze and highs near 60 this afternoon."
Mars bigger/brighter tonight then it has been in the past several years. More info from our friends @earthskyscience: http://t.co/keCy5cVK3g
A bit cooler tonight with west  winds and temperatures falling several degrees. But plenty of sun on Wednesday with highs in the upper 50s.
"In case you haven't noticed, it's warm out! Temperatures in the mid 60s are common this afternoon. West winds remain a little blustery."
"Clouds may take a little while to move out of the picture this morning, but once they do we're expecting temps to warm into the mid 60's."
Things will remain showery and cloudy  through the first half of the morning. Clearing by afternoon -- and warm with a west wind!
Good morning friends! This batch of heavy rain over the area is moving northeast at a good clip. Should be out of here within an hour.
"Severe thunderstorm season is coming. The basics, plus the low-down on SPC outlooks, watches &amp; warnings. Right here: http://t.co/nTbqsF4glK"
Showers increasing in coverage &amp; intensity over the next hour. Rain will become steady throughout the area. Heavy at times tonight.
"Once we get through tonight's rain, tomorrow has potential to be ""surprise"" warm day. Westerly winds, warm air aloft. Upper 60s possible."
Drizzle/showers in the city very shortly. Going to want to keep that umbrella handy essentially from now through the rest of the evening.
"Initial batch of showers is currently very light, but approaching the city in an hour or so. Heavy rain waits until later."
"Northeast progress has slowed a bit, but Yankees may be flirting with light rain by first few innings. Latest radar: http://t.co/KuSlRimo0O"
"Period of heavy rain likely later today, but a pleasant and warmer week is ahead. Details: http://t.co/VDwd2NPQIZ"
"If you're smelling smoke this morning, it's likely from a forest/brush fire in Southern NJ. Incoming rains this afternoon should help."
Yankees Fans: Game will be a race against the clock as steadier and heavier rains move north. Not looking like an ideal Opening Day.
"If you're headed to the Yankees home opener, bring rain gear. It looks increasingly unsettled &amp; showery after 1pm."
"Good morning! After a seasonable start this morning, increasing clouds &amp; a threat for showers by noon. Period of heavy rain likely tonight."
Models in good agreement on incoming storm system Monday night. Period of heavy rain is likely. http://t.co/wS3egIMgSk
"Here's your definition of ""clear skies"". H/T  to our friends at @phillywx. Enjoy the day! http://t.co/RfcUl1bz40"

"Good morning friends. Just a gorgeous day today behind yesterdays storm system. Highs in the 50's, a light breeze and plenty of sun. Enjoy!!"
"Backdoor cold front season is here, what's the deal? We explain them in our latest post: http://t.co/HHqxcgqzwY"
"Drizzle, low clouds hanging tight this morning. East/northeast winds bringing in much cooler and more damp marine air. Bring the umbrella!"
"Steady rain continues into the overnight, tapering off to drizzle by morning. Cooler, damp and drizzly through most of the morning hours."
Amazing. RT “@PabloWeather: It's really is amazing how far weather radars have advanced over the last 40 years. http://t.co/uNAaG6fW2B”
Conditions become a lot more raw and chilly over the next few hours. East winds off cold waters will bring marine air and drizzle.

Clouds finally breaking over western parts of the area. Likely to break in the city within the next hour. Could see a brief temp rise.
Late week weather takes a hit with backdoor front http://t.co/ORDgY9YY2r
Steadiest rain ending from west to east over the next 30-60 minutes. We can start talking about sunshine again in an hour or two.
"Late week forecast does not feature warmth or sun. Warm air to our south, cool &amp; damp in NYC north of warm front. http://t.co/LSBRBMyXmj"
Steady rain moving into Western NJ over the next hour or so. will expand east into the city during the later morning hours.
"Warmer start this morning, and we're in the 60s later this afternoon. But an expanding area of moderate rain over PA will impact us first."
Beautiful. RT “@MissTaraTee: We are home! #sunrise #nyc  http://t.co/pUHuZdfZxz”

Not an April Fools joke: High temperatures could reach the low to mid 60's on Wednesday. http://t.co/zGTstOEoJa
"Very important to monitor position of warm front this week. Cool, raw northeasterly flow north of the front is very typical for spring."

"April off to a wonderful start with warming trend, but raw and cooler marine air may return by late week. Details: http://t.co/mt7xCbW1XB"
