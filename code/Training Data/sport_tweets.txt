Incredible play by Bird. Incredible. But people never realize how hard that layup was DJ made.

RT @NBAcom: Here it is! The full #NBAPlayoffs schedule: http://t.co/oItRFWqRN2 http://t.co/55UiFmJJRW
"To summarize the west: SAS-DAL, OKC-MEM, LAC-GSW, HOU-POR."
"Grizzlies beat Dallas, finish 7th in the west, get OKC in the first round. Mavs finish eighth, get top seed San Antonio. Playoffs are set!!"
Mike Conley hits two FTs with 1.1 seconds left in OT. Grizz up one. Dallas timeout and the ball at mid court.
"OKC win means Clippers locked in at three, will play sixth-seed Warriors in first round."
"Thunder hold on and win, 112-111, over Detroit. OKC finishes 2nd in the west. Monta Ellis just tied the Grizzlies with a 3 with :13 to go."
"Thunder go up one with 16.5 to go on Durant dunk. Forty-two on the night, 21 in the fourth. Incredible."
Grizz up three over Dallas with under a minute left; OKC down one to Detroit with 28 seconds left.
"East playoffs are set: IND-ATL, MIA-CHA, TOR-BKN, CHI-WAS. Intriguing matchups. Don't be surprised if Cats give Heat a tough series."
"Meanwhile, OKC is…down 8 to Detroit in the fourth quarter. If Thunder loses and Clippers win tonight, Clippers finish second, Thunder third."
"Wizards up 16 in Boston after three. Nets, um, certainly don't look like they mind playing Toronto in the first round."
Brooklyn down 17 to Cleveland after three.
"Wizards have pushed lead back out to 14. If WAS holds on &amp; BKN loses at Cleveland, Wizards finish fifth and play Bulls, BKN plays TOR."
"Bulls loss locks Toronto in as the three seed in the east, regardless of TOR-NYK result. CHI locked at four."
"Bobcats win; Wizards must win in Boston to avoid falling to seventh, and Heat in first round. WAS up five in third."
Clean look for Kemba there. Overtime in Charlotte.
"Reasonable guess. RT @FisolaNYDN W/Lamar Odom signing, who wants to bet Phil Jackson signs Andrew Bynum this summer &amp; trades Tyson Chandler?"

"With loss to Knicks, BKN still hasn't clinched 5th in east. Will do so w/win Wed vs. CLE. If BKN loses &amp; WAS beats BOS, WAS is 5th, BKN 6th."
"Of course, I'm assuming GSW gets this W over Minnesota, or Wednesday over Nuggets, to get sixth. Shouldn't do that, probably."
"Winner of Wednesday's MEM-DAL game gets 50th win, finishes 7th in west and probably gets OKC. Loser finishes 8th and gets Spurs. #pickem"
"Grizzlies beat Suns, and clinch the last playoff spot in the west. Phoenix eliminated. Incredible season for PHX, &amp; great future for them."
I believe in conferences. But it is terrible that one of these teams won't make the playoffs.
Warriors would clinch number six seed with win tonight over Minnesota.
"OKC clinches 2 seed in west w/win Wed (DET), but if OKC loses &amp; LAC wins last 2, Clips would win 4th tiebreaker (WC record) and get 2 seed."
"Out west: only locked-in series is Houston-Portland, with both set at 4-5. Spurs have clinched top seed..."
"Bulls have clinched at least fourth, and home court in the first round..."
"With Toronto, Chicago wins, Raptors still 3rd, Bulls 4th. If both win/lose last game, that stays the same. Bulls need to be one up for 3rd.."
"Wizards could still finish fifth if they win their last game and Brooklyn loses its last two. Anything else, Nets clinch fifth..."
"If Wiz lose at Boston &amp; Bobcats beat Bulls Wed, Charlotte finishes 6th, Washington 7th. If WAS/CHA both win or lose, Wiz 6th, Cats 7th..."
Miami locked into second seed. Can still play either Washington or Charlotte in first round. Wiz clinch sixth w/win Wednesday at Boston...
"After East games tonight: Indiana clinches top seed in EC, locked into playing the eighth-seeded Hawks in the first round..."

"If Memphis wins out, it will finish seventh, ahead of Mavs. Grizz also have tiebreaker over Dallas. That would mean Spurs-Mavs, OKC-MEM."
"Grizz control their destiny for eighth spot in west. Half a game ahead of PHX, but MEM has tiebreaker. Grizz @ LAL Sunday, at Suns Monday."
"Mavericks beat Phoenix, clinch playoff spot."
"Fairly big review here, wouldn't you say?"
"With Bulls' win/Raps' loss, Bulls move into third in east. With Wiz win/Cats loss, Wiz back in 6th, Cats 7th. Miami now top seed in east."

Adam Eaton of the #whitesox was involved in a play very similar to the one that just happened to Josh Hamilton.
It was explained to us by an ump supervisor recently in NY. There's going to be confusion over this one.
"I can't explain it in 140 words, but there's more to securing the ball in the ""transfer'' than people commonly think."
It takes more to complete a catch than most people realize. That's why Josh Hamilton got charged with an error. #angels

Chris Paul should have to explain why he was shooting a halfcourt shot with nine seconds left to get the three free throws.
Refs just want to point and laugh at David Lee’s double-team attempt.
I saw Matt Barnes mess up his ankle in a Pro-Am game at Kezar and limp up and down the court for free. He’ll want to play through that toe.
Perkins has to take that shot.
Memphis understandably distracted by the impending arrival of Rob Van Dam on that last possession

Russell Westbrook just retreated to the locker room to grudgingly add Perk to his framily.
The only thing more improbable than that four-point shot was Kendrick Perkins doing something good

"After years of lawsuits, discriminatory tactics and abhorrent ownership, a sidepiece is what finally rid the NBA of Donald Sterling."
Adam Silver says Donald Sterling acknowledged it is his voice on the audio recording.
"""I will urge the board of governors to exercise its authority to force a sale of the team and will do everything ... to ensure it happens."""
"""Effective immediately, I am banning Mr. Sterling for life from any association with the Clippers organization or the NBA."" -- Adam Silver"
"RT @WojYahooNBA: The banishment will include a $2.5 million fine, league source tells Yahoo Sports."
"RT @WojYahooNBA: The NBA will ban Donald Sterling for life, source tells Yahoo Sports."
The Clippers are worth at least $1 billion. The reported $5 million fine for Donald Sterling represents .5%. That's one half of 1 percent.

"Draft pop-up candidate: Spencer Adams, HS RHP in Georgia. 6-5, 180. Reminds scout of young Waino. FB 93-96. Distinct CB and SL, good change."
The Rays have seven errors this season as a team. Royals pitchers have eight errors by themselves.
"It's horrifying to know that people like Donald Sterling still exist. What a wretched, miserable, hypocritical excuse for a human being."
Last Royals rookie starter to go 8 shutout innings before Yordano Ventura tonight was Dan Reichert vs. NYY in 2000. He did it despite 9 BB.
"""One more and that's it,"" Ned Yost says to Ventura, who is at 109 pitches, which I believe is a career high by quite a few."
Ventura back out for the eighth. Just hit 99 against Adam Jones and struck him out swinging at 96. Learn the name: http://t.co/mMCi2RIzKW
Velocity is always an indicator of Ubaldo Jimenez's mechanics. FB sat 88-91 most of the night. Very inconsistent. He misses Mickey Callaway.
"Yordano Ventura's high-90s fastball isn't even his best pitch tonight. His changeup is an absolute monster, and Orioles scoreless thru six."
"The death of the transfer rule, as @Ken_Rosenthal first reported, a good sign MLB's following through on promise to evolve replay as needed."
"For those asking: Among the 77 pitchers who have thrown 100+ mph since 2008, they have undergone Tommy John surgery 19 times total."

"#managerweedjokes RT @RaysJoeMaddon: I'm in favor of legalizing pine tar, but it's usage may have to begin with the Rockies and Mariners."
Ivan Nova's Tommy John surgery will be the 25th confirmed since Feb. 18. At least three more pitchers have been diagnosed as needing it.
"The suspension is not what will teach Pineda to be a little more surreptitious. Grief from his manager, teammates and others will be plenty."
"Facts are simple: MLB had to suspend Michael Pineda because he blatantly broke Rule 8.02(b). But almost every pitcher does, so wrist slap."
"Source: Michael Pineda's 10-game suspension is paid. He will not pay a fine, either."
Michael Pineda gets a 10-game suspension. He'll miss one start.
"And, of course, I'd be remiss if I forgot the only starter whose K-to-BB ratio is infinity: Tim Hudson, who has 20 strikeouts and no walks."
"Welcome to modern baseball with absurd K-to-BB rates: Lee 38-2, Tanaka 35-2, Felix 43-4, Price 40-4, Greinke 40-5, Jose 47-6, Eovaldi 30-4."
"Since his first hit Billy Hamilton is .274/.303/.339 with nine steals in 15 games. Playing + defense in CF, too. Reds will gladly take that."

Source: Jeremy Jeffress was seen at Milwaukee's Maryvale facility today. No confirmation but all signs point toward minor league deal there.
RHP Jeremy Jeffress elected free agency rather than accept an outright assignment from Toronto. Will sign with new team within 24-48 hours.
"On the bright side for the Diamondbacks, they did not sign Loux and got a compensation pick. The player Arizona chose: Archie Bradley."
"This is accurate. Barret Loux. Ouch. RT @TracyRingolsby: Dbacks scouting dept set to take Sale but overruled, forced to take another player"
"One very evident thing in talking to Chris Sale: He does not like advanced metrics. Calling you out, Brian Kenny! http://t.co/l6jQKvzLRX"

Last thing baseball needs are rules like receiver possession and tuck rule in football that everyone thinks make no sense yet still exist.
Note on replay column: The transfer rule is an absolute disaster. Baseball needs to gets umps and personnel together and remedy it quickly.
"To managers, players, writers and everyone else complaining about replay: Stop. It's good now and is sure to improve: http://t.co/MxPp9wTC8Q"
"It's smart business for the Astros to delay. The rules are ridiculous, but the team is well within its rights to handle players how it does."
"If Springer started year with Astros, would hit free agency in 2019. Two-week delay keeps him under team control until after 2020 season."
"MLB season is 183 days. Full year of service 172 days. Astros calling up George Springer, per @EvanDrellich. Delay buys team an extra year."

"Jedd Gyorko extension is five years, $35M starting next season. Breakdown: $2M, $4M, $6M, $9M, $13M with $1M buyout on $13M option for 2020."
"Could not be more proud of my friend @elisaslow for his Pulitzer Prize. And it should be plural, by the way, because he deserved two."
All of this goes back to the humongous TV contracts that already fatten up your cable bill. They also keep baseball from larger exposure.
"It's embarrassing we're in 2014 and Iowa, Oklahoma, Arkansas, Las Vegas, Buffalo and others are systemically kept from watching MLB nightly."

"To clarify, the four nerds that will join me will make a total of five nerds on the set."
"Shared birthday of Omar Vizquel, Carlos Beltan and Chipper Jones. I'll pick my five best switch-hitters ever, offense only. Your five?"
The seamhead edition of Baseball Tonight airs at 10 pm et on ESPN. I will be joined in studio by four baseball nerds.
"Billy Hamilton told me he scored 30 TD's sr year in hs and got 28 a game in hoops. ""Baseball is the hardest game,"" he said ""Not even close."""
"In Pittsburgh for Reds-Pirates, ESPN, 7 pm et. Dave O'Brien and Aaron Boone in the booth. Aaron had more three-homer games than Hank Aaron."
"Giancarlo Stanton is on our five-man all-time home run derby team, joining Frank Howard, Babe Ruth, Bo Jackson and Mickey Mantle. Your five?"
"Harang, Mercker, Maloney only P's since 1900 to twice be pulled from no-no after six. Maloney holds record for most BB's in real no-no:10."
"Some first basemen have never taken part in a triple play. In Scott Sizemore's first game at first, he took part in a 5-4-3 triple play"
"Every day, every game, I check batterymates, just in case. All time favorites are Black and Decker, and Abbott and Castillo."
"Jackie Robinson is the most important player in baseball history, and a great, great player. 1949: 203 hits, 124 RBIs, 86 walks, 27 K's."
"I have never been more certain of anything in my life: no ball in play, no contact."
"Average fan, age 55, hasn't played since high school, gets 100 AB's against Craig Kimbrel at his very best. Does he put a ball in play?"
In Philly with Dave O'Brien and Aaron Boone for Braves-Phillies on ESPN at 7 pm et.
"Every time a pitcher hits a grand slam (Bumgarner), I think of former White Sox pitcher Gary Peters, who never gave up a slam, but hit one"
"Rough year for closers, but not for Craig Kimbrel: 17 batters faced, 11 K's. Or Francisco Rodriguez: 12 batters faced, 9 K's."
Joakim Soria's pitching line from last night. 1-4-3-3-0-3. Do you consider that striking out the side?
Figueroa has all the vowels in his last name. He should loan one to Kent Hrbek
"Happy 35th birthday, Adrian Beltre. Is he a Hall of Famer now? Or, how many more good years does he need?"
Rangers-Red Sox at 7 on ESPN. Tanner Scheppers starts for Texas. He and Tanner Roark are only pitchers named Tanner in baseball history
"In our BP show today 4:30-6:30, Aaron Boone might do impersonations of hitters, pitchers, coaches, etc. They are so perfect, so funny"

"I just walked over the Roberto Clemente Bridge into PNC Park on Opening Day. Seriously, who is the luckiest man on earth?"
"It's Opening Day. My favorite day of the year. This is my 35th as a writer, and it's still as special as the first one. I can't wait!"
Alex Gonzalez had a very good spring for the Orioles. He likely would have started Opening Day at 3b against LH Jon Lester
Tigers at Pirates at 1 pm et on ESPN. Adnan Virk and Doug Glanville in the booth. I'll be the little guy standing in the rain in the dugout
Shelby Miller and John Lackey on the hill. Karl Ravech and Barry Larkin in the booth.
Cards and Red Sox on ESPN today at 1 pm et.
"I am so happy for Eric Nadel. He is a tremendous broadcaster, so smart and so prepared. His Frick Award is richly deserved."
"Halladay is a Hall of Famer. Best pitcher in the game 2002-11. Two Cy's, top five seven times. One of six P's ever 203 W's, .659 winning %"
"Tigers source called Fister ""a very good pitcher, a No. 3 starter.'' The Nationals upgraded their rotation without dealing Anthony Rendon."
"The Tigers cleared money, opened a rotation spot for Drew Smyly and got a LH reliever (Ian Krol). And Steve Lombardozzi is very useful"
"Rest in peace, Michael Weiner. An intelligent, kind, decent man, and a great leader. He will be missed."
Kinsler is now a teammate of Phil Coke. Kinsler's dad was once a prison warden. Coke's dad was once a prison guard.
"Ian Kinsler brings some speed to the lineup, and can hit leadoff, allowing Austin Jackson to hit down on the order"
"Fielder, I was told tonight, didn't like hitting at Comerica Park, which is so big in center and right center. He'll love his new home."
I saw Prince Fielder hit one in the upper deck at Rangers Ballpark in Arlington when he was 11 years old. Now it's his home park.
"I just finished Steve Rushin's new book, The 34-Ton Bat. It is fabulous. Another brilliant piece of work from my favorite writer."
Greg Maddux once went three years without a passed ball occurring with him on the mound. Think about that for a second.
"Hall of Fame voting approaching. Rank 1-5, these first-year candidates, one being the best: Maddux, Thomas, Glavine, Mussina, Kent."

Keep an eye on Mike Napoli swinging 3-0 tonight. He has two homers on 3-0 this year. Only Troy Tulowitzki has that many.

"Matt Kemp was a great high school hoops player. If he played Magic Johnson one on one, make it/take it to 10, what would be final score?"

Machado and Hardy are two of seven players to play every inning of their team's games this year.

The Orioles have out-scored opponents by 19 runs in the first inning this year. Yankees have  been out-scored by 19 runs in the first.

Whoops. Sorry. Forgot to include  runners on base WITH TWO OUT
The Red Sox are hitless in their 16 at-bats with runners on base
"That's 36 strikeouts in 63 at-bats this year for Ankiel. Ridiculous comparison, obviously, but Joe DiMaggio's season strikeout high was 39."
Mets pitchers are hitless in their last 28 at-bats. Cardinals pitchers are hitless in their last 26 at-bats.
Rick Ankiel is one of the game's best throwing outfielders. Who is the greatest throwing left-handed outfielder of all time? This isn't easy
Something to watch early: Mets have scored 14 runs in the first inning this year. The only team that has scored fewer is the Cardinals: 13.
Matt Holliday threw a football before the game. A great high school quarterback. He can still sling it. Baseball players are great athletes
"New Met CF Rick Ankiel's equipment bag was left behind. Using Scott Rice's glove, John Buck's bats and ""I don't know which guy's spikes.''"
In St. Louis for Mets-Cardinals on ESPN at 7 pm ET. Love this town.
Arroyo out after 97 pitches. That's 10 straight starts for him under 100 pitches
Choo has been hit by a pitch 11 times this year. Mickey Mantle was hit by a pitch 13 times in his career
Simmons has not made an error this year. Tim Hudson told me that Simmons is the best defensive SS he has ever played with
"Arroyo averages 3.95 strikeouts per nine, lowest rate among qualifiers. He has six K's tonight in 3 1/3 against the free-swinging Braves"
Arroyo has walked one of the last 118 batters he has faced leading off an inning
"With that out by Jay Bruce, left-handed hitters are 4-for-57 against Maholm in his last nine start"
"Arroyo averages 13 pitches per inning, fewest among ERA qualifiers. He threw 27 in the first inning"
"Johnny Cueto threw a bullpen today. No setbacks this time with his oblique. Either one more bullpen, or straight to a rehab assignment"
"Jason Heyward took BP on the field for the first time since surgery. Reported no issues. He has been out two weeks, but is getting closer"
"In Cincinnati for Braves-Reds. 7 pm et on ESPN. I just watched Evan Gattis take BP. Whoa. Seen it before, but breathtaking every time."
"ARod played more games at SS than any position, so he qualifies. Ernie Banks played more games at 1B than any position. So, he doesn't"
"Baseball Tonight at 12:30 ET on ESPN. We will pick the greatest SS of all time. Please send your top 5, in order. This is so difficult."
"Four innings in and we've had two pickoffs, and two other guys thrown out on the bases"
Dan Uggla now 11 for 22 against Strasburg
The two best throwing shortstops in the game today are here tonight in Simmons and Desmond. Am I missing someone?
"Strasburg just got a GIDP, only his second in the last 12 starts. Great turn by Danny Espinosa. No 2Bman in the game throws better than him"
Kurt Suzuki took the first pitch. That's 60 straight plate appearances for him without swinging at the first pitch
Strasburg walked the leadoff man. He has allowed at least one baserunner in the first inning in 10 straight starts.
"Harper called Jones for advice on being a big leaguer last May, then followed him around at the All-Star game. Good guy to follow around"
"Chipper Jones said before the game that Bryce Harper is ""way better than I was. Way better.'' And Jones is a top five 3Bman all time."
Brian McCann played in a 10:45 am game today in A ball. Caught nine innings. All went well. Could return to Braves next week.
At Nats-Braves on ESPN at 7 pm et. Watch Strasburg early. He has allowed a baserunner in the first inning in each of his last nine starts.
"Baseball Tonight is on at noon ET for an hour on ESPN2. We will pick the best third baseman of all time. I need your top three, in order."
"Cervelli popped out on the first pitch. That was only the third, first-pitch out recorded by Matt Moore this year."
"Matt Moore went 0-1 on the second hitter, then got an out. Hitters are 1-30 against Moore this year when he gets ahead in the count, 0-1"
Rays have one LHH (Sam Fuld) in the lineup against Sabathia. He has not allowed a homer to a LHH in his last 13 regular season starts.
"Youkilis (tightness in back) replaced by Overbay. Yanks have four LHH's in the lineup vs. Moore. Last eight starts, LHH's 4-39 vs. Moore"
Watch how many strikes Sabathia throws with his fastball tonight. Likely not many. But he can get people out with his secondary stuff.
"Curtis Granderson is hitting off a tee and soft toss. Next step, BP in cage. ""I'm still a ways away,'' he said. Mid-May logical. Not May 1"
At The Trop for the Yankees-Rays tonight at 7 et on ESPN. CC Sabathia vs. Matt Moore.
"Baseball Tonight is on today at 12:30 ET on ESPN2. We will pick the three best 2Bmen of all time, in order. What is your top three?"
"Ryan Howard has 50 at-bats and only one home run, the first time he's ever gotten to 50 at-bats in a season with fewer than two home runs"
Lee has now gone 164 hitters without a walk. He had a 163 walkless in '09. The 164 is the longest since Maddux's 244 in 2007.
The Reds are hitting .115 with two out and runners in scoring position this year. They are hitless in their last 19 ABs in those situations.
"Ben Revere is from Lexington, Ky., an hour from Cincy. His grandfather is at the game tonight. He has seen his grandson make two great plays"
"Dusty Baker's dad asked him long ago, ""What does 1949 mean?"" Dusty said, ""The year I was born.'' Dad: ""Yes, and the year Jackie won MVP''"
"Jackie Robinson Day. He changed the game, he changed America and he was a great player: six World Series, six All-Star games in 10 years"
In Cincy for Phillies-Reds on ESPN at 7 ET. Lee vs. Arroyo. Strike throwers. Lee has not walked any of the last 147 batters he has faced.
"Baseball Tonight at noon for an hour on ESPN2. We will select the best first baseman of all time. Please send us your top three, in order."
Ruben Tejada just swung at the first pitch for the first time this year
"Matt Harvey's stuff is tremendous: high 90's, slider, curveball and a really good change-up. Great makeup. And, the son of a coach."
"Ben Revere has the most career at-bats((1,094) among active players without a home run. The next 35 on the list are pitchers"
Ruben Tejada has not swung at the first pitch in 23 plate appearances this year
Two K's for Harvey. No Met has ever struck out 10 in his first two starts of any season. The last pitcher to do that was Kerry Wood in 2002
"No extra base hits in 25 at-bats for Ryan Howard, the longest into a season he has ever gone without an extra base hit."
The Phillies have stolen a base in every game this year. Mets starter Matt Harvey has not allowed a stolen base attempt in 11 career starts
David Wright is now 4-for-25 with 13 strikeouts against Roy Halladay.
"With RISP, opponents hit .304 against Halladay last year. The previous two years, they hit .205"
"I did a radio show this winter, and twice the host referred to Ben Revere as Ben Vereen. Yikes."
"Larry Bowa caught the first pitch. He told me he took infield before every game of his career. If it rained, he played pepper in the cage."
Mets catchers had 48 RBIs last year. They have 10 this year. John Buck is off to a great start. He has taken control of this pitching staff
"I don't care how irrelevant this is. Mets OF Collin Cowgill is ambidextrous. Bats RH, throws LH. Rare. Shoots a basketball LH, dribbles RH"
The Phillies have taken a form of early infield three times since the start of the season. It is coach Ryne Sandberg's work to improve the D
"Matt Harvey was late to the park recently, fined $250. Terry Collins said Harvey would get it back if he threw seven scoreless tonight."
I asked Charlie Manuel about the last time he dunked a basketball. 46 years ago. He played on a rec league team with Jim Kaat and Bud Grant
"At Mets-Phillies tonight. On ESPN at 7. Halladay goes for No. 200 against an emerging star, Matt Harvey."
"Best catcher ever? I want your top three, in order. This is not easy"
"Today is the season debut of the Sunday morning Baseball Tonight. 12:30 pm et, ESPN. Writers, a quiz and I'll pick the best catcher ever."
"Youkilis is one of six to make their Yankee debut Monday, the highest total of Yankee debuts in any game since the first game in 1903"
"The Yankees did not hit a home run on Opening Day, ending a major league record streak of 14 straight Opening Days with at least one homer"
"David Ortiz told me with no setbacks, he would be ready to play in a major league game in 10 days"
"Ichiro, 39, was the oldest Yankee outfielder ever to start on Opening Day"
"Jackie Bradley Jr went shopping for suits Tuesday with Shane Victorino. Bradley met, and had his picture taken with, Donald Trump"
"Most of the Red Sox were on the noon bus for a 7 pm game. Not sure what that means, but it has to be a good sign"
"At Yankee Stadium for Red Sox-Yanks, 7 p.m., ESPN2. Last time Sox started 2-0 was 1999. Last time Yanks lost first two, both at home: 1982"
"The last time the Red Sox-Yankees and Dodgers-Giants played on Opening Day, the same day, was 1926"
Victorino now 3-for-25 in his career on Opening Day
Jackie Bradley Jr. was amazingly composed before his first major league game. Teammates talk all the time about his presence
Youkilis is one of eight players from championship 2004 Red Sox to go on to play for the Yankees
"This will be eight straight years that Sabathia has started Opening Day, longest among active pitchers. Halladay's 10 ends today"
Baseball Tonight is looking for pictures from ballparks on Opening Day. Please send to #BBTN
At Yankee Stadium for Opening Day. My first one as a writer was 1980. It is still a big thrill
We are televising the Mets at Nationals today at 1 pm. The Nats are the best team that I've seen this spring.
"Ike Davis, I am told, has been better than ever against lefties, and is moving better than ever at first base"
"Just a hunch: David Wright will play Opening Day, Daniel Murphy will not and Johan Santana will make his first start around May 1"
"Great reports this spring on Matt Harvey. Re-shaped body, good stuff, great competitor. Big year ahead"
"At Mets with Ravy, Sut and Boonie. We're doing the Mets-Cards game at 1 pm"
"My list, best Yankees ever, in order: Ruth, Gehrig, DiMaggio, Mantle, Berra, Ford, Jeter, Rivera. What is your top eight?"
Where does Mariano Rivera rank among the all-time Yankees?
The Bus is in Lakeland with the Tigers today. We will interviewing Justin Verlander and Jim Leyland.
The Bus is with the Yankees today in Tampa. Baseball Tonight at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2. We will be interviewing Joe Girardi and Derek Jeter.
Stephen Strasburg is still angry about how last year ended for him and his team. Being angry is good if you can channel it. He can.
Ryan Zimmerman said his repaired right shoulder feels great. He threw across the diamond today for the first time this spring. No problems.
"We will be interviewing Davey Johnson and Bryce Harper today. If you had one question for each, what would it be?"
"The Bus is with the Nationals. Baseball Tonight at 3 p.m. ET on ESPN2. Not looking for weaknesses, but can anyone see one with the Nats?"
The Bus is with the Cardinals today. Curt Schilling joins us. He is the best baseball player ever to wear No. 38.
"The Bus is in Red Sox camp today. The Red Sox are much improved, but their 5.19 ERA by their starters was their highest since 1920."
"The Rays practiced at length this morning the five-man infield drill, just in case they use it once or twice this year."
"Is everyone aware of how dominant Rays reliever Jake McGee can be? Last year, 55 IP, 33H, 11BB, 73K's."
"So far, so good with SS Yunel Escobar, who has had a history of focus/concentration issues. It helps that Maddon can talk to him in Spanish."
"Maddon's options at 2B are Kelly Johnson, Ben Zobrist, Ryan Roberts and Sean Rodriguez. Maddon calls it ""the quad-toon.''"
"Two Rays told me that new OF Wil Myers is a better runner, a better athlete, than they expected. Plus, special power. We'll see him May 1?"

Dwight Howard had the highest turnover rate on post-ups among high usage bigs. Two travel violations early.
Blazers doubled Dwight. Passed to Beverley in the corner 3. Bang. That's the risk.
"Chandler Parsons motioning to Omer Asik after that foul, ""Stay down on 'em!"" LMA got 'em with that pumpfake."
Dwight Howard looking gassed after 13 quick points. Omer Asik in the game.
So how long can they keep single-covering Dwight Howard?
This game so far: Blazers can't stop Dwight Howard. Rockets can't stop anyone.
